### **Renee Bajaj** ###

__Hello!!__

My name is Renee Bajaj and I am a second year student. I am studying a Bachelor of Science, specialising in Data Science. I am really enjoying my degree and am getting more and more interested in analysing data through R.

**This repo is for:**
- working on my STATS220 projects 
- practicing things I learn in class!!

_Here are 5 facts about me:_
1. I grew up in Lower Hutt but moved to Auckland to escape the gale force winds :wind_face:
2. I am an only child. I guess my parents realised they had their hands full with just me :girl:
3. My favourite chocolate is Snickers. I could probably live off them :yum:
4. I work at Countdown on Quay Street. Come visit me :grin:
5. I love reading books whenever I have time between uni and work which is not often anymore :open_book: :pensive:
